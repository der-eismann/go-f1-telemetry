# How to create SVGs

I created these by using a debug version which kept drawing the position of my car
(only mine), after which I drove the track first at the left line, then at the right
line, then back to the box and last I stopped at the finish line. This can then be
saved as a PNG. Some of them were rotated to make better use of the space.

Afterwards I created a SVG and copied the PNG in it as the background. In the foreground
I copied an export of the track from [openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org) 
and then tried to align the actual track to the in-game trail.

Feel free to use them as you like, but it would be awesome if you could give me credit
as it took me some hours to create all of them.
